        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I’m Ann Charity — a developer and technical writer who builds thoughtful systems and clear documentation using React, Python, JavaScript, and SQL. I focus on asking sharper questions, writing to clarify complex ideas, and contributing to collaborative projects like DevShare and custom management tools. My approach is simple: work carefully, communicate clearly, and leave a trail others can follow. Still learning. Still building. Still becoming.</p>
